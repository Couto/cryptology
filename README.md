# cryptology

This is a small repository with my attempt to implement some historical cryptographic algorithms while also learning ES6, this is mostly for educational purposes.

Current implementations are quite naïve, and no security or optimization measures are considered while implementing them, also most of these algorithms are no longer considered secure, so don't even attempt to use them in real applications.

## Implemented Ciphers
 * [Caesar Cipher]()
 * [Simple Substituition Cipher]()
 * [Playfair Cipher (WIP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair_cipher)

## Planned Ciphers
 * [Vigenère Cipher]()
 * [Affine Cipher]()
 * [Enigma Cipher]()

## Instructions

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Couto/cryptology
cd cryptology
npm install
npm test
```
