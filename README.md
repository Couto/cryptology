# cryptology

This is a small repository with my attempt to implement historical cryptographic algorithms, this is mostly for educational purposes.

Current implementations are quite naïve, and no security measures are considered while implementing them, also most of these algorithms are no longer considered secure, so don't event attempt to use them in real applications.

## Implemented Ciphers
 * Caesar Cipher
 * Simple Substituition Cipher
 * Playfair Cipher (WIP)

## Planned Ciphers
 * Vigenère Cipher
 * Affine Cipher
 * Enigma Cipher

## Instructions
